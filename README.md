# Study-Focus-App
The Study Focus App uses gyroscope data from an Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense and a machine learning model built with Edge Impulse to monitor phone activity. While the phone remains still on the table, the app tracks study time. If the phone is lifted, an alarm is triggered and the timer stops, encouraging users to maintain focus and avoid distraction.
